# Coacher App - Diet and Workout Plan Generator

This is a Rails-based web application designed to help users generate personalized workout and diet plans based on their preferences and needs. The app leverages AI-powered content generation (via API) to create customized workout and diet plans in response to user inputs.

## Features
-   **Personalized Diet Plans**: The application generates custom diet plans based on user information such as age, weight, height, sex, activity level, and dietary preferences.
-   **Personalized Workout Plans**: The application generates custom workout routines based on user objectives, fitness level, and preferences.
-   **AI Integration**: The app uses a third-party AI API to generate responses for both diet and workout plans based on user input.
-   **Seamless User Experience**: Users simply provide input about their diet or workout needs, and the application returns a well-structured plan in JSON format.

## Technologies

-   **Ruby on Rails**: The backend is built with Ruby on Rails to manage the API endpoints, database, and web interface.
-   **AI API Integration**: The application calls an external API for generating workout and diet plans based on user input.
-   **JSON Output**: Both workout and diet plans are returned in a structured JSON format, making them easy to interpret and display.

## Setup
To get this application up and running locally, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

-   Ruby 3.x or higher
-   Rails 6.x or higher
-   PostgreSQL (or any database of your choice)
-   API Key for the AI API (e.g., Gemini API)

### Installation

3. **Setup Environment Variables**:
The application uses an external AI API for generating workout and diet plans. Youâ€™ll need to set up environment variables to provide the API key and base URL.

In the root of your project, create a `.env` file (or use any method to manage environment variables):

```bash
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BASE_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=
